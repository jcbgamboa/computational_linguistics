# Computational Linguistics

This is a course on Computational Linguistics. This is a slightly adapted
version of the Computational Linguistics course I gave during the Summer
Semester of 2020 in the Technische Universität Kaiserslautern as part of my
studies there as a PhD student
([I still am a PhD student there](https://jcbgamboa.github.io/public/pages/about/)).
I am thankful to the Technische Universität Kaiserslautern and to my
advisor Professor Shanley E. M. Allen for the opportunity to prepare these
classes during my PhD.

This course was not produced only by me. While the vast majority of the
materials you'll see in this page were (heavily) edited by me, some of
them were partly organized/produced/written/inspired by
two other people who also gave this lecture in its very first iteration
(in 2018): Philipp Blandfort and Kristina Kolesova.
Still... this does not necessarily mean they endorse everything I say in
my videos.

**Protip**: Since I speak quite slow, you may want to increase the
  reproduction speed of the videos, especially if you already know a little
  what you are watching =)


Context
-------

This course is focused on students of the Master on Cognitive Sciences of
the University of Kaiserslautern. At this point of the Master, the students
normally do not have a lot of programming background, but learnt some Java
in another class. Therefore, I try to be very "gentle" in my introduction
to the command line and to Python. Still, at the very end of this course
we do see some quite-close-to-state-of-the-art applications, so hopefully
the learning curve is not too steep.

When teaching this course, I used an online platform, where I could upload
videos. The platform also offered a forum where students could ask
questions, and a some space for Downloads.
I tried filtering out a few of the references to the
forum and to the "Downloads folder" in the materials, but some of them are
just impossible to remove. So if you find any one I've left in, just
consider that
 * the "Downloads folder" should be interpreted now as the _Downloads_ page
   in the menu to the left;
 * the "forum" should be interpreted now as the comment pages of the
   Youtube videos.


Organization
------------

The course was organized in 11 weeks of content (this is what the "W"
means in the menu links), plus a free week for the
students to solve questions, and finally a week for the exam. Every week
the students had to answer questionnaires about the content of that week,
which counted as their "attendance". Additionally, on every
Wednesday, we used
[Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/)
to have a call in which the students could ask any questions they might
have, be it about the questionnaire or about any administrative issue
(e.g., they could ask about the exam, or say that the online platform
had been down for a few days, or let me know that I forgot to answer a
forum post, or anything like that).

(I still intend to find a way to release the questionnaires, just in case
anyone is wondering)


Licence
-------

I am not fully sure I own everything that I am posting here.

For things that I don't own (which I believe are none),
and in case someone who does own something here wants their ownership to be
respected, I am happy to take down whatever they tell me to.

Except for the things listed in the previous paragraph
(which I believe are none), everything here
is licenced according to the following licence (however, read below a few
details):

The following things are owned also by Philipp Blandfort (they were mostly
created/idealized by him, and I then heavily changed them for the purposes
of this course).
In these cases, if you use them, mention both of us as authors =)

Notice that the slides have only my name because I cannot be sure that
Philipp "endorses" their final form.

notebooks, the other slides, and the Youtube videos), you can mention only me
as the author.
