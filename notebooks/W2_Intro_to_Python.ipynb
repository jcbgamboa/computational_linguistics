    "Computer languages can be either compiled or interpreted. Compiled languages, like C, C++ or Java, require the code to be input to a compiler, which reads the code and outputs a binary file. This binary file is then either executed directly by the operating system (as is the case of C) or executed by another program (as is the case of Java, that uses the `java` program).\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreted languages are different. Each line of code is given separately to an interpreter. The interpreter reads the line and executes the code. If the line is not finished for some reason (say, it opened a parenthesis, but never closed it), the interpreter normally considers the next line as a continuation of the previous line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compiled languages are useful for several reasons. The compiler (the program that transforms the code into a program) has access to the entire code file, and therefore can sometimes reorder the execution of some lines so that they are executed more efficiently by the computer. In practical terms, this means that compiled codes are potentially faster when compared to interpreted languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compiled codes are also \"smart\" and sometimes might just strip parts of the code. For example, consider the following line:\n",

    "In the example above, the variable `y` is tested twice: the program tests whether y is 0 and y is 1. Of course, y can't be both 0 and 1 at the same time. So that `print` statement will just never run. Compilers often notice this kind of trivial bad statements and just strip them from the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since compilers see the entire file, it is not necessarily expected that they will run the code file from the beginning to the end. Instead, they normally have an \"entry point\" from which the code start running. In C, this is a function called `int main()`; in Java, it is that function name that you always have to remember: `public static void main(String args[])`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreted languages are different. They don't have access to the entire file all at once, and they don't generate a new binary file. They just run the code that is given to them. This has several implications."
