Exercises
=========

I made weekly exercises that counted as the "presence" of the students in the
class. As I gave them to the students, it became clear that they contain quite
a lot of "bugs" (typos, strange wordings, etc), but I thought I'd make them
available anyway because I feel they are still valuable to direct the students
toward what is "important" to know from this class.
