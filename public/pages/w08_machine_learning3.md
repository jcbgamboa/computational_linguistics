W8 Machine Learning (part 3)
============================


Overfitting
-----------

Along with the "W8.1" video on Overfitting, I'd like you to watch the video
below. It is more or less a different explanation of the same ideas, and I
think it would be useful for you to watch both:

The jupyter notebooks that I used, as well as the paper that I show in the
last video of this week, are available in the Download Folder.

Part of Speech (POS) tagging
----------------------------

Before proceeding to the next video, I'd like you to watch these two videos
from Youtube. I believe you should be able to understand them well with the
information you have so far. Let me know if you have doubts =)

An Intro to Parts of Speech and POS Tagging

Some Methods and Results on Sequence Models for POS Tagging

Additionally, if you still didn't watch those 3Blue1Brown videos on Neural
Networks (the two videos on classifying handwritten digits using a neural
network), I'd like you to stop now, go back to the last week's materials,
and watch it. You will need that information for understanding the last video
of this week.

The following video is about a few common NLP tasks. POS Tagging is normally
solved with statistical models (like Neural Networks); but the other tasks I
refer to in the video are normally not really "learnt" statistically:

Putting it all together
-----------------------

In the last video of this week I "dissect" the following paper:

 * R. Dhumal Deshmukh and A. Kiwelekar, "Deep Learning Techniques for Part of Speech Tagging by Natural Language Processing," 2020 2nd International Conference on Innovative Mechanisms for Industry Applications (ICIMIA), Bangalore, India, 2020, pp. 76-81, doi: 10.1109/ICIMIA48430.2020.9074941.

However, since I go through the whole paper in the video, explaining what
it does and showing its whole text, it is probably not ok for me to upload
the video here.

_(I'll see what I can do. Just reading the paper is not
going to be super interesting: the reason I took this paper is because I
could show how the few concepts we've learnt already are enough to
understand quite a lot; but it will be hard to map the concepts we've
learnt without some guidance =/ )_
